/**
 * Wire protocol between the harness host and the in-distro agent
 * (`agent/agent.mjs`).
 *
 * One JSON object per line on both pipes, each request carrying an `id` that
 * its reply echoes. That is the whole framing: the channel is a pipe inside
 * one distro, so no length prefix, no escaping layer, no multiplexing header.
 * Binary payloads ride as base64 in the `data` field.
 *
 * This module is shared by the host side only — the agent is plain JS and
 * restates the shapes it answers. `tests/protocol.test.ts` holds the two ends
 * to the same table.
