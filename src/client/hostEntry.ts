/**
 * Join the host's own Workspaces header instead of standing beside it.
 *
 * The shell exposes one seat to a third-party client plugin
 * (`sidebar.footer.action`); the section header the user asked to sit in is
 * host-private markup — `WorkspaceBrowser` renders it itself and its slot
 * children carry no hole for header actions (`sidebar.workspaces.directoryFlow`
 * is the only single seat and the directory pickers already own it). So the
 * entry mounts as a plain DOM node beside the shipped "Add workspace" control,
 * by the same technique the shipped workspace browser itself accepts:
 *
 * - the shipped control's own `className` is copied, so size, radius, hover and
 *   focus are the shipped behaviours rather than lookalikes;
 * - the button is drawn through the same Tooltip primitive the shipped control
 *   uses, so the hover bubble is the shipped bubble, not a native `title` box;
 * - the entry is kept in place by observers, because React re-renders the strip
 *   underneath (search expansion, workspace list changes) and drops unknown
 *   children with it.
 *
 * Nothing in the host is patched: no module is wrapped, no service is replaced.
 * The mount falls back to the footer action whenever the header seat is absent
 * (rail sidebar before the region mounts, a release that renames the classes).
